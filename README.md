## 📌 About This Repository

This is an **open-source, ongoing, continuously-evolving LangChain JS learning project** created by **Paresh**.  
The goal is simple:

👉 **Teach LangChain JS from absolute zero to advanced with clean, runnable examples.**  
👉 **Each topic = a self-contained lesson (folder) with its own README + code.**  
👉 **Explained in ELI5 style: super simple, super practical.**

This repository is structured like a **hands-on course**, not just random scripts.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Building real AI applications requires more than calling an LLM.  
You need:

- Chains  
- Tools  
- Agents  
- RAG  
- Embeddings  
- Web scraping  
- Automation  
- Multi-agent systems  
- LangGraph workflows  

However, official docs are scattered and lack practical examples.

This repo fixes that by providing:

✔ Simple explanations  
✔ Real code you can directly run  
✔ Modern LangChain v1 structure  
✔ Multi-agent + tool + automation examples  
✔ Practical steps for real-world AI development

---

## 🧠 Why This Repo Will Help You

✔ Makes LangChain JS extremely beginner-friendly  
✔ Every lesson works directly via `node <filename>`  
✔ Covers everything needed for modern AI backend development  
✔ Perfect for MERN developers transitioning into AI  
✔ Each concept explained with clarity + comments  
✔ Updated continuously with new lessons & examples  
✔ Helps you build production-grade AI systems, not toy demos  
✔ Great for your resume + GitHub profile
